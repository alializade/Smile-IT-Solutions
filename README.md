# ⚡️ Smile IT Solutions - Task Assignment ⚡️

---

### An internal API for a fake financial institution

For the purpose of proving myself to the Smile IT Solutions professional team, I created this
project.

Hopefully, it's `convincing` enough...

### Getting Started

Navigate to the cloned project, then run the `installer.sh`:

    $ git clone git@github.com:alializade/Smile-IT-Solutions.git Smile-IT-Solutions 

    $ cd Smile-IT-Solutions

    $ docker compose up api

- To prevent any conflicts, it is recommended to stop all running Docker containers.


- After the initial process is over, the server will be available through the `http://localhost`
  address


- Import `./docs/postman_api_collections.json` file to the Postman application

### Notes

- I know that in professional code, consistency is imperative, so if you see different approaches to
  coding, it is on purpose to demonstrate knowledge diversity and flexibility.

### Requirements

- PHP >= 8.1
